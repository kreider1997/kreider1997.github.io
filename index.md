#**Keith Kreider**
In 2014 it became clear to me that my future, at least my happy future, required a change of careers.  Not just a job change, but a new direction.  The problem was, how do I do it, and what do I do.  As time went by it became clear that my options were very limited.  My job did not allow me the time to go back to school or pursure any sort of side job.  The time and expense of going to school was also an issue.  In August I learned about a new opportunity called the Iron Yard.  Located less than 3 miles from where I lived, its creedo was "Life is too short for the wrong career.  Learn to Code".  I have always been comfortable with computers.  While my coding experience was limited, my desire to learn and grow in a field that I'm comfortable with made this a tempting opportunity.  After thinking about it for a few weeks and talking it over with my wife, I decided now is the time.  So, on September 22nd, I started my journey to a new career.
