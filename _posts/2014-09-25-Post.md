#### Day Four

Homework was difficult.  I ended up have some file issues that prevented me from completing it fully.  However, as the day went on today, everything really clicked well.  We received our weekend homework and it’s time to restart fresh.  We need to take what we learned the past few days and apply it.  Everything goes well until I create my own Tree Mile Island and nuke my repository on GitHub.  This would be like your dog eating your homework, then your house catches on fire and your dog runs away.  Fortunately, I was able to figure out how to recreate my repository through a little trickery and with my up to date local clone on my laptop.  Not sure how I did it, but it worked.  Yay brain (and luck)!  At least I can look at this as some good “git” practice.
