#### Day Five

Today we continue our homework but we also have a guest speaker!  It looks like Friday’s will be guest speaker day.  [Olivier Lacan]( http://olivierlacan.com/about/), Software [Bricoleur]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bricolage), my word for the day, at [Code School](www.codeschool.com) gave a short talk to the class.  He reinforced the importance of version control and how little many programmers today use it.  What we have learned on version control with GitHub in less than one week is more than 90% of current programmers know, not to mention newly minted programmers coming to the market. Competitive advantage, check!  It was great to see what we are learning used in real time by a business.  It was a good presentation.  Homework is going really well.  Too well.  I get that feeling like I need to [cool the engines]( http://www.last.fm/music/Boston/_/Cool+The+Engines).  I spend some time setting with my other classmates.  Listening to their questions and the answers from others helps a lot.  There is so much that I don’t know, it helps a great deal to hear someone ask something I would not have thought of.
