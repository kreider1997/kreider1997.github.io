### **9/23/2014 Blog Post**
#####Day Two
We start the day with the task to start a blog.  I am horrible about taking about myself and bloging is something that I never thought I would do.  This will be interesting!
OK Blog, I don't like you, and you are in-animate so you don't care.  But lets do this.
We are jumping in deep into the world of Git.  My first big hurdle is to stop typing "get".  I'm getting there.  I'm feeling good with the concepts but everything is so new.  
While I'm trying to become friends with GitHub, we are introduced to Cloud9, terminal, Jekyll, Basecamp and general markup.  That is a lot for one day.  
We start to cut our teeth on creating a website.  This will hold our blog and become the repository that our future work will live on for others to see in a web based univers.  Awsome!
I struggle with finding a way to share my information with Cloud9 and GitHub.  I'm getting there, but there is always a twist.  As it starts to rain, the day comes to an end.  Time to wrape up and speend some time practicing my git commands.  Tonight will be a late night.
