#### Day Three

We start our days with a stand up.  As a group, we stand up and form a circle and proceed to tell everyone what we worked on yesterday, what we are going to work on today and what is getting in our way.  This is something that [David]( http://about.me/al_the_x) uses when consulting.  My big take-away from this morning’s stand up, I need to learn everyone’s name.
We really dive into Cloud9 today.  We are now using our knowledge of Git, to manage a local and remote repository to build a very basic web site that will hold our blog.  This website will evolve to something wonderful.  Right now, its lame.  Some of the class that has HTML and CSS experience is very excited to apply their knowledge to start building a website adding fancy backgrounds, themes and add ons.  I’m not there yet.  Still need to learn to walk before I run.  I struggle with managing through some unique error messages and a finicky Wifi.  We have our homework.  Time to “git” to work!
